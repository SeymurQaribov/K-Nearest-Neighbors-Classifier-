# K-Nearest-Neighbors-Classifier-
K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier for Diabetes Dataset
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the application of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier on a diabetes dataset. The main purpose of this script is to showcase the process of training a KNN classifier, making predictions, evaluating its performance, and visualizing key results.

Dataset and Columns
The diabetes dataset used in this project contains information about various health indicators and the presence or absence of diabetes. The main columns in the dataset include:

Pregnancies,
Glucose,
BloodPressure,
SkinThickness,
Insulin,
BMI,
DiabetesPedigreeFunction,
Age,
Outcome (0: No diabetes, 1: Diabetes)
Main Purpose
The primary objective of this script is to demonstrate how to perform the following steps using a KNN classifier:

Data preprocessing, including handling missing values.
Scaling the data for better KNN performance.
Splitting the data into training and testing sets using stratified sampling.
Selecting the optimal value of k using cross-validation and grid search.
Training the KNN classifier on the training data.
Making predictions on the test data.
Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC score.
Visualizing the decision regions of the KNN classifier using the plot_decision_regions function.
Analyzing the classification results and hyperparameter optimization.
